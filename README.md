# Space-Invaders
2D Space Invaders game written entirely in C. Move the laser canon and destroy incoming aliens before they touch down!

To compile, you will ned the ncurses library which is only available on linux (to my knowledge). 

Simply run this command to compile:

```make -r lab4```

And this command to run the game:

```lab4 alt_bounce.sa```

I've included other .sa files to run, but recommend the one mentioned above.
